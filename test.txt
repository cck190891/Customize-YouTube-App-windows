Determine all the pairs of positive real numbers $(a, b)$ with $a < b$ such that the following series $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \int_a^b\{x\}^k dx =\int_a^b\{x\} dx + \int_a^b\{x\}^2 dx + \int_a^b\{x\}^3 dx + \cdots$$ is convergent and determine its value in function of $a$ and $b$.

[b]Note: [/b] $\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.

You can swap the integral and summation by tonelli's theorem. From there it's not too bad.

If we first switch the order of the integral and the summation, we obtain an infinite geometric series that sums to

{x}/(1-{x}) = -1 + 1/(1-{x}) = -1 + 1/[(1+floor(x)) - x] (i)

CASE I (0 < a < b < 1):
If we consider 0 < a < b < 1, then the integral of (i) over (0, 1) evaluates to:

-x - ln(1 - x)  =>  [b][u][i](a - b) + ln[(1 - a)/(1 - b)] [/i][/u][/b](ii)

which is convergent.  

CASE II (N <= a < b < N+1):
If we consider N <= a < b < N+1 for any positive integer N, then the integral of (i) over [N, N+1) evaluates to:

-x - ln(1 + N - x) => [b][u][i](a - b) + ln[(1 + N - a)/(1 + N -b)][/i][/u][/b] (iii)

which is also convergent.

CASE III (N <= a < b < N+k):
If we consider N <= a < b < N+k (where N is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer greater than unity), then the integral of (i) over [N, N+1) U [N+1, N+2) U ..... U [N+(k-1), N+k) evaluates to:

(a - b) + ln[((1+N)-a)/((1+N)-(1+N))] + ln[((2+N)-(N+1))/((2+N)-(N+2))] + ... + ln[((N+k)-(N+k-1)/((N+k)-b)];

or (a - b) + ln[((1+N)-a)/0] + ln[((2+N)-(N+1))/0] + ... + ln[1/((N+k)-b)];

which is divergent.

Hence, we require positive integers a, b (a < b) such that [a, b] lies within the intervals (0, 1) U [N, N+1) (N is a positive integer).
